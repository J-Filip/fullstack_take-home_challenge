## First solution - MVP

- check this branch - https://github.com/J-Filip/fullstack_take-home_challenge/tree/first_attempt_mvp

## Second solution - vanilla js SPA


- in my second attempt, I didn't change any of the backend code (strictly followed the challenge instructions) and only added one endpoint. It's a simple attempt without any framework or client-side routing.
